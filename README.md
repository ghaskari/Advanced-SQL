# Advanced SQL Kaggle

## Syllabus 

- JOINs and UNIONs

Combine information from multiple tables.

- Analytic Functions

Perform complex calculations on groups of rows.

- Nested and Repeated Data

Learn to query complex datatypes in BigQuery.

- Writing Efficient Queries

Write queries to run faster and use less data.

## Introduction
In the Intro to SQL micro-course, you learned how to use INNER JOIN to consolidate information from two different tables. Now you'll learn about a few more types of JOIN, along with how to use UNIONs to pull information from multiple tables.

In the second part of the course, you learned how to use aggregate functions, which perform calculations based on sets of rows. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to define analytic functions, which also operate on a set of rows. However, unlike aggregate functions, analytic functions return a (potentially different) value for each row in the original table.

In the Third part, you'll learn how to query nested and repeated data. These are the most complex data types that you can find in BigQuery datasets.

In the last part, how to write effecient quesries is discussed.
